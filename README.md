# üí´ About Me:
I am a former IT Business Analyst, now IT Architect, with a big passion for web development, spending a large amount of my free time to develop web applications to solve different problems for small business owners.

### Bootcamp Projects (from 2023):
In the pinned section in my profile you can find some of the projects i worked on during my bootcamp in the spring/summer of 2023 with URLs to the vercel deployment of the project to test what it does and get an overview of the functionality. The repository itself is also public, so feel free to take a look at my beginner codebase. Every single project had a specific issue to solve, so a lot of the codebase was already provided. The ISS Tracker had the frontend already build, i only connected the tracking API, implemented the moving dot (based on a provided calculation logic) and the automatic refresh logic. For the Tourio App and the Fish-Shop i only connected to an MongoDB Atlas Database and provided a datamodel with very little frontend logic like deleting data. The Rick and Morty App frontend was also provided and i connected the API, implemented the pagination logic and the search logic. 

The Capstone-Project was our final project in which we worked with a Kanban Method, had to write our own requirement with Github Projects, give the requirement to a QA process (checking for things like acceptance critiera, size of the feature etc.), implement the requirement and then go through a QA process of a code-review based on a PR, followed by a deployment into integration, a QA process for the UI Testing of implemented logic and only then being allowed to merge our branch into main. The Capstone-Project was an application we could choose on our own and nothing besides a required techstack (next.js, mongodb & test implementation with jest) and the described QA process was specified. I have chosen a fitness tracking application, which doesn't have all the logic i wanted to implement, but was a very interesting process to go through, because i have figured out how time consuming QA can be and how important it is to get feedback from the code-reviews and the UI-QA process. The main lesson learned was to commit often and not overcomplify the requirement process, because issues will hit you along the way while implementing the feature, so you have to give youself some room to figure stuff out while coding. Coming from my Business Analyst/Requirements Engineering background this was especially interesting, because i could learn a lot from "the other side".

### Current Project (since summer 2023):

I am currently working on a web application in my own side business (german Nebengewerbe), which i am going to launch as a SaaS and is a private project within my github repository. I started this project right after finishing my Web Development bootcamp at neuefische in summer 2023.
It is an application based on the create.t3.gg stack including Next.js, Prisma, Tailwind, Typescript, Zod, tRPC & Next-Auth. I have implemented a whole signUp Workflow which is GDPR compliant and a payment process for the application with paddle.com (UK based Merchant or Record). The application itself is going to be deployed on Vercel and my MySQL database is hosted at Planetscale. Based on this criteria its considered a Fullstack-App.
